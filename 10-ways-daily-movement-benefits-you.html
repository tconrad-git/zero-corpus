<p>We all know physical activity is important, but many of us struggle to get our daily dose of movement. In fact, according to a recent report by the CDC, as many as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0120-inactivity-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25% of U.S. adults</a> are <a href="https://health.gov/paguidelines/second-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not active enough</a> to protect their health — in practical terms, that’s around <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2712935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 to 300 minutes</a> of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each week.</p>



<p>The pros of leading an active lifestyle are numerous for both the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short and long-term</a>. In fact, regardless of your current habits, physical activity is one of the most effective ways to <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invest in your health</a>. Here’s why!</p>



<h2>How Daily Movement Benefits You in the Short-Term</h2>



<p>After a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/health-benefits-of-physical-activity-for-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single bout</a> of moderate-to-vigorous exercise (think a brisk walk or jogging), your body starts responding immediately — kind of like a physiological “thank you.”</p>



<h3>#1. It Lowers Your Blood Pressure</h3>



<p>Just 15 to 30 minutes of physical activity can lower <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002870306002651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a> for several hours after the fact. That’s basically a quick stroll around the block with Fido!</p>



<h3>#2. It Strengthens Your Immune System</h3>



<p>Moderate physical activity that lasts 60 minutes (or less!) has been shown to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254618301005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost immunosurveillance</a> (the circulation of your body’s defense cells to identify and remove pathogens) as well as prevent illnesses such as the common cold and the flu.</p>



<h3>#3. It Helps with Brain Cognition and Anxiety</h3>



<p>Engaging in daily movement has immediate <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1469029218301870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive impacts</a> on brain function and can even <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00027/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lessen feelings of anxiety</a>. Brief, moderate-intensity physical activity lasting at least 10 to 20 minutes is enough to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899312004003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost executive function and recall memory</a>.</p>



<h3>#4. It Betters Your Sleep</h3>



<p>Early birds get the worm <em>and</em> catch the Zs. Research shows that a morning workout can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945717301508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve nocturnal sleep quality</a>. Sign us up!</p>



<h2>How Daily Movement Benefits You in the Long-Term</h2>



<p>Physical activity is by no means a one-and-done deal. All the benefits you reaped in the short-term accumulate to a bountiful harvest in the long-term, which means that, by prioritizing movement, you’re moving —&nbsp;metaphorically and perhaps literally —&nbsp;in the right direction.</p>



<h3>#5. It Aids in Healthy Weight Maintenance</h3>



<p>A 10-year research study with over 15,000 participants demonstrates that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/0802886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtually any increase</a> in physical activity —&nbsp;yes, even <a href="https://oguyajournal.com/OIJCI/article/view/162/169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">golf</a> —&nbsp;aids in maintaining a healthy body weight.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#6. It Supports Metabolic Health</h3>



<p>According to a <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/48/3/233?wvsessionid=wv5a48bcd3dde64a0694b0d38557a6cbb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12.5-year study</a>, physical activity in the form of daily tasks and chores (like mowing the grass or gardening) is associated with improved metabolic health and reduced all-cause mortality rates.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#7. It Encourages Fat-Burning and Enhances Body Composition</h3>



<p>Research demonstrates that fasted exercise sends signals to your body that <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/effects-of-aerobic-exercise-performed-in-fasted-v-fed-state-on-fat-and-carbohydrate-bolism-in-adults-a-systematic-review-and-analysis/0EA2328A0FF91703C95FD39A38716811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stimulates fat-burning</a>. Routine, low-to-moderate-intensity exercise while in a fasted state of at least 12 hours is shown to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6983467/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fat-burning machinery</a> and may contribute to enhanced body composition.</p>



<h3>#8. It Contributes to Musculoskeletal Strength</h3>



<p>Physical activity is crucial to building <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/56/5/B209/554584?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy muscles</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6179512/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong bones</a> — especially for women, who may be at higher risk for osteoporosis. Building consistent movement habits now only becomes <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521694217300530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more important</a> as we get older because our bodies gradually lose the ability to maintain our hard-earned muscle mass and bone density.</p>



<h3>#9. It Supports Cardiovascular Health</h3>



<p>One of the most well-known benefits of exercise is <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.914721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular health</a> — that’s where “cardio” got its namesake, after all! Research dating back to the 1950s compared heart disease rates of active bus conductors with seated bus drivers, and coronary heart disease was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673653914950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50% less</a> prevalent for bus conductors who spent their day moving, walking about, and climbing stairs.</p>



<h3>#10. It Prevents Cancer</h3>



<p>Research suggests that up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804910007069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 out of 5 cancer cases</a> could be attributed to lack of sufficient physical activity. And, if you want to be extra cautious, the <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a> recommends exceeding 300 minutes of physical activity per week for optimal cancer prevention.</p>



<h2>So What Do I Do Now?</h2>



<p>So you know the incredible benefits of being physically active, but how can you incorporate this knowledge into your day-to-day? Getting active doesn’t have to be hard. Shoot for 20 to 30 minutes of movement and you’re golden. Walking, dancing, mowing the lawn, yoga, CrossFit, running after your sock-loving pup — it all counts.</p>



<p>Physical activity — like nutrition and sleep — is a pillar of good health. But, in order to maximize the benefits of daily movement, we encourage you to stack it on top of other healthy habits. Before you know it, your lifestyle will be changed for the better so you can enjoy a longer, happier life.</p>
